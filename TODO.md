# To Do List
General
- ~~Make song selection screen and link to it from the intro screen~~
- ~~Make song selection buttons which each load a specific song and beatmap~~
- Create a tutorial scene which explains each of the different hit objects and their functions
- Create a results screen which will show the players score and hit accuracy.

Game
- Switch to the score screen after the last hit note has finished playing. 
- Make hit sounds more subtle

Beatmaps
- ~~Create EASY difficulty beatmap~~
- Create NORMAL difficulty beatmap
- (In Progress) Create HARD difficulty beatmap
- Create XX difficulty beatmap

HitObjects
- Allow flick notes to be able to end on a different path than they started from (stretch)
- Allow drag notes to be spawned with more than simply a start and end position (3+ position which allows for more advanced movement)
- Allow drag notes to be spawned on a curve (as opposed to linearly)

Editor
- Allow players to be able to edit their own beatmaps within the game
- Allow players to be able to save their own beatmaps to their filesystem.
